This is a work in progress note/todo app to explore some 
interesting tech, including:

* [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/)
* [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/)
* [Apollo Graphql](https://www.apollographql.com/)
* [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html)
* [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

The app uses an sqlite in memory db by default to store data. It supports 
hot module replacement in dev mode.

## pre-requisites
* node 
* yarn or npm

## running
* yarn
* yarn start
* yarn test

roadmap/coming soon:
* support for other db providers
* production build support (including docker) 
* socket-based push updates
